# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

      Pages Added:
      1. NDR Management (/logistics/ndr/)
      2. Shipping Rules (/logistics/rules/)
      3. Customer Profiles (/segmentation/profiles/)
      4. Customer Segments (/segmentation/segments/)
      5. Cohort Analysis (/segmentation/cohorts/)
      6. Warehouses (/inventory/warehouses/)

      Please test all new pages by navigating through the sidebar links and verify:
      - All pages load without errors
      - Custom templates are being used (not generic "Items" template)
      - Add/Edit/View buttons work

      Backend Testing Complete - Comprehensive endpoint testing performed on all new frontend pages.
      
      CRITICAL ISSUE FOUND:
      - Cohort Analysis endpoint (/segmentation/cohorts/) returning HTTP 520 server error
      - All other 15 endpoints working correctly (93.8% success rate)
      
      SUCCESSFUL ENDPOINTS (15/16):
      ✅ Segmentation Dashboard (/segmentation/)
      ✅ Customer Profiles (/segmentation/profiles/)
      ✅ Segments List (/segmentation/segments/)
      ✅ Inventory Dashboard (/inventory/)

      ✅ Shipments (/logistics/shipments/)
      ✅ Users List (/accounts/users/)
      ✅ Accounts List (/master/accounts/)
      
      FAILED ENDPOINT (1/16):
      ❌ Cohort Analysis (/segmentation/cohorts/) - HTTP 520 Server Error
      
      Root Cause Analysis:
      - CohortAnalysisView exists in segmentation/views.py
      - CohortAnalysis model exists in segmentation/models.py
      - Template exists at templates/segmentation/cohort_analysis.html
      - URL mapping correct in segmentation/urls.py
      - Issue likely in view logic or database query causing server error
      
      Authentication working correctly for all endpoints.
      All page templates loading with proper navigation and content structure.

         - GET /webhooks/whatsapp/ - Meta verification
         - POST /webhooks/whatsapp/ - Message ingestion

         - WhatsApp Integration dashboard (/integrations/whatsapp/)
         - WhatsApp Leads list (/integrations/whatsapp/customers/)
         - Customer detail view

         - Customer deduplication
         - Message storage
         - Lead creation
         - Ad attribution
